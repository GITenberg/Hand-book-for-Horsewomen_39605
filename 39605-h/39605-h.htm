<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>For many years two styles of riding have
prevailed in Western Europe&mdash;the English and
the continental or school system. The two are
usually supposed to be somewhat antagonistic,
so much so that the followers of each are not
unapt to regard the other with feelings of
more or less dislike, not to say contempt; the
one side being sneered at as pedants, the other
despised as barbarians. To the unprejudiced
both seem somewhat unreasonable.</p>

<p>The English method, originating in the
national taste for field sports, has developed a
race of horsemen worthy of that noblest of
animals, the thorough-bred horse. The chief
essential for the race-course and the hunting-field,
however, being high speed on lines that
are practically straight, the tendency of Englishmen
is to leave their horses very much
alone, provided they can gallop and jump and
are sufficiently under control not to run away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the rider usually keeping a pretty even pressure
on the bit and making comparatively little
attempt to regulate the animal's action by the
use of his own legs.</p>

<p>The school, on the other hand, is the nursery
of cavalry; and, for the army, speed is not so
much needed as uniformity of movement and
general handiness in rapid and complicated
evolutions. Hence the great military riders
of the continent have aimed at bringing the
horse under complete control, and to this end
they have applied themselves to the problem
of mastering his hind legs, which are the propelling
power, and therefore the seat of resistance.
And it is precisely this subjection that
horses dislike and try to evade with the utmost
persistence. To accomplish the result,
the rider is taught so to use his own legs and
spurs as to bring the animal's hind legs under
him, and thus carry him forward, instead of
letting him go forward in his own way, as the
English do. By balancing the effect of leg and
spur upon the hind quarters, against the effect
of hand and bit upon the mouth, the horse is
brought into a position of equilibrium between
the two, either at rest or in motion; he is then
in complete subjection, and can be moved in
any direction at his master's will. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
basis of the whole manege system, and it is
thus that horses are made to <i>passage</i>, to <i>piaffer</i>,
or even to trot backward.</p>

<p>The objection to the method is that, as equilibrium
is gained, initiative is diminished, and
this, together with the pedantry of the old-fashioned
professors of the <i>haute école</i>, served to
bring the whole theory into disrepute.</p>

<p>Looked at impartially, nevertheless, it must
be admitted that each system is well adapted
to accomplish its own peculiar objects, and
thus it seems at least reasonable to suppose
that ordinary people may be the better for
learning something from both.</p>

<p>Amateurs, and especially ladies, do not expect
to confine themselves to the silk jacket or
even to the hunting-field, any more than they
propose to give <i>haute école</i> exhibitions in the
circus. What the majority of men and women
need for the park, the road, or even for hunting,
is well-bitted, well-gaited animals, with
light mouths, broken to canter on either leg,
and easily gathered for a jump.</p>

<p>But such horses when bought are not to be
ridden off-hand. To begin with, the finer the
training the more likely the beast is to turn
restive if the rider leans on the reins. A seat
independent of rein and stirrup is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the first requisite. Secondly, supposing the
seat satisfactory, no one can know, by the light
of nature, how to stop a highly-broken horse,
to say nothing of making it change its leg or
gather for a jump. A certain amount of the
art of management must therefore be learned to
make an accomplished rider.</p>

<p>Now, beginners can get a seat in one of two
ways. As children in the country they may be
brought up on horseback, as they often are in
the Southern States and in England, in which
case the difficulty will quickly settle itself; and
this is doubtless best if practicable. But supposing
it to be impossible, a pupil may be well
taught by exercises in the school, just as officers
are taught at West Point or at Saumur. One
thing alone is certain: seat can never be acquired
by desultory riding or by riding exclusively
on the roads or in parks.</p>

<p>Next, as to management. Without doubt
the English dash and energy&mdash;in a word,
rough-riding&mdash;is the first essential for any
one who hopes to be either safe or happy on
a horse. It is the foundation, without which
nothing can avail. It means seat, confidence,
and decision. Yet there is something more
that may be learned without at all impairing
these qualities. To handle the horse rap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>idly
and neatly, a control more or less complete
must be established over his hind legs.
In no other fashion can the thing be done.
To attain this, it is not necessary or even desirable
to go into all the niceties of the <i>haute
école</i>. Horsemen want to arrive at certain
practical results for their own safety and comfort,
and the problem to be solved is, how to
accomplish them by rational and gentle means.</p>

<p>Ladies certainly do not care to <i>passage</i> in
the streets, but they do want to know how to
stop their horses cleverly when they take
fright, to turn their corners neatly at the trot
without danger of a fall, and to avoid instantly
any obstacle they may unexpectedly meet. It
is also well to understand something of the
simpler methods of regulating gaits. All
these things may be learned best by studying
the rudiments of the school system, and it is
with rudiments only that this treatise pretends
to deal.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-five years many
hand-books on equitation have been written for
men, but few for women. This is the more
remarkable as a woman's seat is such that she
can not produce the same effects or use the
same means as a man. Instruction for him is
therefore largely useless for her. Men astride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
of a horse hold him between their legs and
hands in a grip from which he can not escape,
and can direct and force him with all the resolution
and energy they possess. Women, sitting
on the left side, must supply the place of
the right leg as well as they can. They are, of
course, obliged to resort to various expedients,
all more or less artificial and unsatisfactory
certainly, but still the best they can
command. Yet it is for these very reasons far
more important for women than for men to
understand the art of management, since they
must rely entirely on tact, skill, and knowledge,
not only to overcome the difficulties of the
cramped and unnatural seat imposed on them
by fashion, but to supply their lack of physical
strength. Still, there is no reason for discouragement,
for that these obstacles can be surmounted
by intelligence and patience, and that
women can learn to ride on something like
an equality with the best men, the number
of undoubtedly fine horsewomen sufficiently
proves.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>It has been held by some professors of the art
of horsemanship that it is impossible for a lady to
ride with as much ease and as much control of her
horse as a man, on account of the disadvantages of
her high saddle and the absence of the right leg as
a controlling agent; but the result of my experience
has shown me that this is a mistaken opinion. Under
the systems according to which riding was formerly
taught, however, the judgment was a just one, because
the object to be attained was the maintenance of the
horse in what may be called a state of momentary
equilibrium, or equilibrium of the second degree, by
means of a double bit, curb and snaffle, aided by repeated
slight pressure of the spurs. Under the more
modern system the double bit is often replaced by a
simple snaffle with one direct rein and one passing
through a running martingale. The results obtained
are more scientific and delicate, and the horse may
be kept in a state of sustained equilibrium, or equilibrium
of the first degree, in which condition he is
entirely under the control of the lady who knows
how to make a judicious use of her whip in place of
the absent spur.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two very different ways of riding; the
more usual, because the easier, consists in letting the
horse go forward at a walk, a trot, or a gallop, the
rider contenting herself with guiding him, and staying
on his back; while, in the other, the will as well
as the action of the animal is controlled, and he is
<i>carried</i> forward in obedient and intelligent sympathy
with his rider. This requires study, tact,
and discretion; but the result well repays the labor,
and, until it is reached, no lady, however well she
may look on horseback, can be reckoned a horsewoman.</p>

<p>I can not too strongly recommend to parents the
greatest care in the choice of a teacher for their children,
as in later years it always takes more time and
trouble to correct bad habits than it would have
done to acquire good ones in the beginning. As a
general rule, riding-teachers are promoted grooms, or
men of that class, who may be able to show boys
how to become good rough-riders, but who are quite
incompetent to teach a young lady the scientific
principles by which alone she can obtain a thorough
mastery of her horse.</p>

<p>And here I hope that my readers will allow me
to offer them, with the deepest respect, a few suggestions
in regard to dress, as years of teaching have
shown me that much of a lady's power on horseback
depends upon her feeling at ease in the saddle, and
consequently free to give her attention to her teacher
and her horse.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>For full dress, such as park-riding, no hat is so
distinguished as a plain high silk one; but in the riding-house,
or in the country, the low Derby shape, or
a soft felt, is now generally worn. If the shape is
stiff, it should be carefully fitted to the head, for
greater security and to avoid the risk of headache,
and in any case an elastic should hold it firmly in
place. Little girls usually wear their hair flowing
on their shoulders, which saves trouble; but older
riders should braid it closely to the back of the head
below the hat, and pin it very securely, as the motion
of the horse is apt to shake it loose, and a teacher
can scarcely expect much attention from a pupil
whose hat vacillates on her head at every step, or
who is obliged to stop her horse in order to replace
rebellious hair-pins.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as a rule that ornaments of
every kind, and even flowers, charming as they are
at other times when worn by a lady, are out of place
now that horsewomen have deigned to copy in their
dress the simplicity of the sterner sex. Rings are
especially to be avoided, as they are apt to cause the
fingers to swell, and thus hinder a firm grasp of the
reins.</p>

<p>The best gloves are of thin, flexible dog-skin,
and they should be a size larger than those usually
worn, to allow the hand and wrist as much freedom
as possible.</p>

<p>If a lady does not object to sacrificing appearances,
she will find great benefit from riding some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>times
without gloves. A horse's mouth is often a
very delicate instrument, and the vibrations which
it gives to the reins are felt much more readily by
the bare hand.</p>

<p>Tailors almost always try to make a habit very
tight fitting, especially at the waist; but a lady's position
on horseback is at best an artificial one, and
unless she is at ease in her habit she will never look
at home on her horse. The constraint caused by a
tight collar or arm-hole soon becomes intolerable,
and the chances are that a tight waist will give the
rider a pain in her side if her horse leaves a walk.</p>

<p>Whether trousers or breeches are worn, they
should fit closely, and no seams should be allowed
where they will come between the wearer and the
saddle, for a seam, or even a fold, is apt in a short
time to mean a blister. Trousers should be kept in
place by straps of cloth about two inches wide, which
pass under the feet. Gaiters are warm and comfortable
for winter; but care must be taken to have very
flat buttons on the outside of the right leg, as that
presses against the flaps of the saddle; and, for the
same reason, when breeches and boots are worn,
the buttons which fasten the former above the ankle
should be on the inside of the right leg. It is better
to wear laced boots instead of buttoned, with
trousers, because the Victoria stirrup, which is now
generally used, is liable to press against the buttons
and catch them in a way that is uncomfortable, and
may be on occasion even dangerous.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Woven merino under-clothing will be found more
comfortable than linen, as that is apt to get into folds
and wrinkles, and ladies may also find it convenient
to have their collars and cuffs attached to a sort
of shirt, as that will remove the necessity for pins
and elastics, which are always likely to get out of
place.</p>

<p>Although her single spur is at times a most valuable
adjunct to a lady, it should never be worn by
beginners, nor until its use has been thoroughly
taught in the course of study.</p>

<p>It is with regret that I see the riding-whip becoming
superseded by the handle of the English
hunting-crop, as this is neither rational nor practical,
being too short and light to replace the right leg
advantageously or to give efficient punishment if it
is needed. A good whip, flexible, without being
limp, rather long than short, not too heavy, but well
balanced, is best, especially in the riding-school.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend to parents that,
when a daughter begins to ride, it should be on her
own saddle, made on her measure, or at least amply
large for her, as riding on a short saddle leads to a
cramped and ungraceful seat. The correct size
should allow the space of three fingers between the
end of the saddle and the base of the spine, when
the right knee is round the second pommel. Some
teachers recommend that the saddles of young pupils
should be covered with buckskin, and this is
often very useful; but when a firm and well-bal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>anced
seat is once acquired, there is nothing like
pig-skin.</p>

<p>The third pommel, or leaping-horn, is an important
and now almost invariable addition to a lady's
saddle, and should be so placed that it does not
press, nor even touch, the left leg, while it is not
needed, and yet so that its aid may be obtained at
any time by slightly drawing up the left leg. It
should stand out enough from the saddle to cover
the top of the thigh, and be slightly curved but
not too much. I have seen this pommel made so
long and so sharply curved that the left leg was fairly
inclosed, and this may be dangerous. As it is movable,
a pupil need not be allowed to become dependent
on it; nor should it be too tightly screwed into
place, as, during a long ride or lesson, it is sometimes
a relief for a lady to be able to turn it slightly.
The slipper stirrup is often used for children and
beginners, and has the advantage of being warm in
winter, but the disadvantage that a habit of pushing
the foot too far home is easily acquired, and not so
easily got rid of when the Victoria, or, better still, a
plain, open stirrup, is used later.</p>

<p>The material and workmanship of a saddle
should be of the best quality, and the less stitching
and ornamentation the better. Style on horseback
depends on simplicity.</p>

<p>Girths seem to hold better if crossed&mdash;that is to
say, if the girth which is buckled to the forward
strap on the right side of the saddle is fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the second strap on the left; and the saddle should
be so firm in its place that a lady may hang for a
moment by her hands from the first pommel on the
right side, or the second on the left, without causing
it to shift its position. The stirrup-leather should
pass under the horse outside the girths, and be
connected with another strap on the right side of
the saddle, in order to counterbalance the pressure
on the stirrup. I may as well say here that a lady's
saddle is well placed when there is a space, of the
breadth of four fingers, between the right side and
the upper end of the shoulder.</p>

<p>I am accustomed to use for my pupils a simple
snaffle with double reins and martingale, as by
this means beginners do less harm to the mouth;
and my own experience, as well as that of many
others who have given it a thorough trial, is that this
bit is preferable to any other for the riding-school,
the road, or perhaps even for hunting, both on account
of the simplicity of its effects upon the horse
and of its mildness, so much greater than that of
the curb, which often irritates and exasperates a
spirited animal. No horses are more ready to bolt
than the thorough-breds on the race-track, yet jockeys
never ride with anything but a snaffle. They
allow their horses to gain a pressure on the bit, and,
as the jockey pulls, the horse quickens his pace. If
you do <i>not</i> permit your horse to bear on the bit, you
will gain by its simple means all those "effects of
opposition" of which I shall speak later, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
are difficult to master, especially for beginners. I
am aware that this opinion is contrary to that usually
held both here and in Europe, as it certainly is
to the teaching of Mr. Baucher. Yet, as it is the
final result of many years of experience, I venture
to submit it to the public, although I can hardly
hope that it will win general assent. It may be
necessary to add that success with the snaffle presupposes
a fine seat and some experience, as tact and
skill must replace the loss of leverage. I consider
the "Baucher" snaffle the best, as the bars on either
side prevent it from slipping into the horse's mouth
under a strong lateral pressure.</p>

<p>Almost all riding-teachers have been educated
in the army, where the reins must be held in the
left hand, to leave the right free for the saber, and
they continue to teach as they were taught, without
considering that in civil life the right hand is
practically unoccupied. When the horse is moving
in a straight line, it is easy to gather the reins into
one hand; but when the rider wishes to turn him to
the right or left, or make him give to the bit, two
hands are just twice as good as one, and I can see
no reason for always riding with the reins in one
hand.</p>

<p>I have been often asked at what age a little girl
should begin to ride, and I should suggest eight
years as a reasonable time. If a child begins thus
early, it is as well that she should take her first half-dozen
lessons in her jacket and trousers, as the cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>rect
position of the legs is of great importance, and
it is, of course, much more difficult for a teacher to
judge of this through a skirt.</p>

<p>Riding lessons are best begun in the autumn, as
winter is apt to be cold for beginners, who are not
able to keep themselves warm by trotting, and in
summer flies often make the horses nervous, which
may disturb young or timid pupils.</p>

<p>The duration of the first lesson should be from
twenty-five to forty-five minutes. The older the
pupil is the shorter the lesson ought to be, although
this rule is not without exceptions.</p>

<p>The usual proportion is: From 8 to 12 years, 45
minutes; from 12 to 20 years, 30 minutes; after 20
years, 25 minutes.</p>

<p>After the first five or six lessons they may be
gradually lengthened, day by day, until an hour is
reached, and one hour in the riding-school under instruction,
if the pupil holds herself in the correct
position, is sufficient. When the lesson is over, the
pupil should rest for a short time before changing
her dress, and walk about a little in order to re-establish
a free circulation of the blood. It is always
wise for a lady to walk her horse for at least
ten minutes before she dismounts, both for his sake
and her own.</p>

<p>The morning after her first lesson the pupil will
feel tired and stiff all over, especially in the shoulders,
legs, and arms. The second day the stiffness
will be worse, and on the third it will be at its height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
after which it will gradually wear away&mdash;that is to
say, if she continues to ride every day; but if she
stops between her lessons the stiffness will come
back after each one.</p>

<p>If a child has any organic weakness, the teacher
should, of course, be told of it, in order that he may
allow intervals for rest during the lesson; and it is
probably needless to add that a child should not be
allowed to ride during digestion. Here I should like
to say a few words to the pupils themselves.</p>

<p>Never hesitate to ask your teacher to repeat anything
you are not certain you understand. Teachers
often take too much for granted, and in riding all
depends on mastering the rudiments.</p>

<p>Have confidence in your teacher, and do not be
disappointed if your progress is not perfectly regular.
There are days in which you may seem able to do
nothing right, and this is discouraging, and may
last for several days at a time; but, on looking
back at the end of a week, or, better still, a month,
you will see how much ground you have gained.</p>

<p>Remember that upon your teacher rests a grave
responsibility. Other instructors are only brought
into contact with one will, and that one harmless;
while the riding-master has to deal with two: that of
the pupil, which is dangerous from inexperience,
and that of the horse, which is dangerous from his
strength, consequently he is often obliged to speak
with energy in order to keep the attention of the
horses as well as their riders. To ride well on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
horseback is to place yourself, or cause yourself to
be placed, upon a saddle; to remain there at ease
in a position which has been calculated and regulated
by certain rules, and to make your horse go
when, where, and as you will. You cannot learn to
do this if you are impatient of correction or sensitive
to criticism, even though sometimes severe.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapt-summary">Mounting&mdash;Dismounting&mdash;The position on horseback&mdash;Manner
of holding the reins.</p>


<h3>MOUNTING.</h3>

<p>The custom which prevails in many riding-schools
of allowing pupils to mount from steps or platforms
seems to me not only unscientific, but irrational, unless,
indeed, the pupil is too small, too old, or too
stout to be mounted in any other way; unscientific,
because there is a correct and prescribed method of
mounting from the ground, and irrational, because, if
a lady dismounts away from the riding-school, and
has not been taught this method, she will be obliged
to go to the nearest house in search of a chair or
bench, or at least must find a fallen tree-trunk or a
big stone before she can mount again.</p>

<p>The pupil should advance to the left side of her
horse, which is supposed to be standing quietly with
a groom at his head, to whom she will hand her whip,
taking care not to flourish it in such a manner as to
startle the animal. She should then turn and face
in the same direction as the horse, let her skirt fall,
and put her right hand on the second pommel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
her saddle, her left hand on the right shoulder of
her assistant, who is stooping in front of her, and her
left foot, the knee being bent, into his left hand.
She should then count three aloud: at one, she
should prepare to spring, by assuring herself that she
is standing squarely on her right foot; at two, she
should bend her right knee, keeping the body straight;
and at three, she should spring strongly from her
right leg, straightening also her left as she rises, and
steadying herself by a slight pressure on the shoulder
of her assistant, who rises as she springs. She must
be careful not to push his hand away with her left
foot, as this weakens his power to help her, and as
she rises she should turn her body slightly to the
left, so that she will find herself, if she has calculated
her spring rightly, sitting on the saddle sideways,
facing to the left. She will then shift her right hand
from the second to the first pommel, turn her body
from left to right, lift her right leg over the second
pommel, and put her left foot into the stirrup.
Afterward she will arrange her skirt smoothly under
her with her left hand.</p>

<p>Two elastic straps are usually sewn on the inside
of a riding-skirt to prevent it from wrinkling. The
right foot is intended to be slipped into the upper
one, the left into the lower, and, if possible, the
pupil should do this just before she mounts, as it
will save her and her assistant time and trouble after
she is in the saddle. As soon as she can mount
with ease, she should also learn to hold her whip in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the right hand, which rests on the second pommel.
These are trifling details, but they help to render a
lady self-reliant, and it may happen to her at some
time to ride a horse who will not stand patiently
while straps are being arranged and a whip passed
from hand to hand.</p>

<p>I offer here a few suggestions for the use of any
gentleman who may wish to assist a lady to mount.
He should stand facing her at the left side of the
horse, his right foot slightly in front of his left. He
should then stoop and offer his left hand for her
foot. Unless the lady is an experienced rider, he
should place his right hand lightly under her left
arm to steady her as she rises. He should count
aloud with her, one, two, three, and at three he
should straighten himself, giving a strong support
for her left foot.</p>

<p>There are two other ways of helping a lady to
mount: the first consists in offering both hands,
with the fingers interlaced, as a support for her foot;
and in the second he appears to kneel, almost touching
the ground with his left knee, and holding his
right leg forward with the knee bent, in order that
she may step on it and mount as if from a platform.
Both these ways seem to me to be dangerous, as, in
case the horse moves his hind-quarters suddenly to
the right, as the lady rises, which is not uncommon,
she will be suspended in space, with nothing to
steady her but her hand on the pommel, and may
fall under the horse's feet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>If a lady wears a spur she should always tell her
assistant, who will then be careful that her left heel
does not touch the animal's side. I have often been
asked if it is possible for a lady to mount alone;
and it is certainly possible, although not very convenient.
She may either avail herself of a fallen
tree, a stump, a fence, or any slight elevation, which
is, of course, as if she were to mount from a platform
in the school; or she may let down her stirrup
as far as she can by means of the strap on the right
side of the saddle, take firm hold of the second
pommel with her left hand and the back of the saddle
with her right, put her left foot into the stirrup,
and give a quick spring with her right leg, which, if
she is active, will land her in the saddle, after which
she can shorten her stirrup-leather. A lady will
probably never in her life be called upon to mount
alone in a flat country, but she can never have too
many resources, and it is easy to make the attempt
some time when riding alone in the school.</p>


<h3>DISMOUNTING.</h3>

<p>The horse having come to a full stop, the pupil
may let the reins fall on his neck if he is very docile,
slip her left foot out of the stirrup and both feet
out of their elastic straps, pass her right leg over the
second pommel, and sit sideways on her saddle for
an instant; then give her left hand to her assistant,
who stands at the side of the horse, and let herself
slip to the ground. If she should be very stout, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
if her feet are cold, or she is tired, it will be easier
for her to drop both reins and to place her hands on
the shoulders of her assistant, who can steady her
arms with his hands.</p>

<p>A lady may, of course, dismount without help by
keeping her right hand on the second pommel and
slipping down; but she must be careful not to jerk
her horse's mouth with the reins, which she should
hold in her right hand.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend teachers and parents to
insist that these exercises of mounting and dismounting
be practiced frequently, as their usefulness is
great.</p>


<h3>THE POSITION ON HORSEBACK.</h3>

<p>It has often surprised me to see the indifference
of parents to the manner in which children carry
themselves and manage their bodies and limbs,s
whether standing, walking, or sitting.</p>

<p>Although they have sometimes more than enough
of science, literature, and music, their physical culture
has been neglected, so that they are not conscious
of the bad habits into which they have fallen, and
which become deeply rooted and almost second nature.
At last the riding-master is called upon to render
graceful the bodies which have been allowed for
years to acquire ungraceful tricks. If a lady wishes
to ride really well, and to look well on her horse, she
must be supple and straight, without stiffness, as
rigidity precludes all idea of ease and elegance, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
say nothing of the fact that no horse looks at his ease
under a stiff rider.</p>

<p>During the first lessons a pupil is apt to have a
certain unconscious fear, which causes a contraction
of the muscles; and it is in order to overcome this
fear, and consequent rigidity, that the following gymnastic
exercise is recommended:</p>

<p>The pupil should be mounted on a very quiet
horse and led into the middle of the school, where
the teacher, standing on the left side, takes in his
left hand her right foot, and draws it very gently,
and without any jerk, back toward the left leg; the
pupil should then place her left hand in his right,
and her right hand on the first pommel, and, thus
supported, lean back until her body touches the
back of the horse, straightening herself afterward
with as little aid from the teacher as possible, and
chiefly by the pressure of the right knee on the second
pommel. This movement should be repeated,
the pupil leaning not only straight back, but to the
left and the right, the teacher holding the right foot
in place and making the pupil understand that it is
to the fixity of contact between her right knee and
the pommel that she must look for the firmness and
consequent safety of her seat on horseback. When
the pupil has acquired some ease in this exercise,
the teacher will allow her to practice it without his
hold on her right foot, and will afterward withdraw
the support of his right hand, until finally she becomes
able to execute the movements while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
teacher leads the horse at a walk in a circle to the
left, his right hand being always ready to replace her
foot in position if she should extend it forward.</p>

<p>This exercise will indicate at once to the teacher
any muscular rigidity on the part of the pupil, which
he can therefore correct by the following movements:
Stiffness of the neck may be removed by
flexions to the right, to the left, back and to the
right, back and to the left, straight forward, and
straight back, always gently and without any abruptness.
For stiffness in the spine, the pupil should
lean far forward and then backward, bending easily
at the waist and keeping the shoulders well down
and back. If the shoulders are stiff, the pupil should
keep her elbows close to her body, the fore-arm being
curved, and the wrists on a level with the elbow;
then let her move her shoulders as far forward, backward,
up, and down as she can, first separately, then
together, and at last in different directions at the
same time. Very often rigidity in the shoulder comes
from stiffness in the arm, when the following flexion
will be found useful: The arm should be allowed
to fall easily by the side, and afterward lifted until
the wrist is on a level with the elbow, the fingers
being shut. The elbow should then be moved out
from the sides and raised until it is on a level with the
shoulder, with the fore-arm horizontal; after which
the wrist should be raised in the air, keeping the
elbow bent at a right angle, and the fingers in front,
the arm being afterward stretched to its full length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
perpendicularly, and finally returned to its place by
the side, after going through the same motions in
reversed order. This exercise should be done first
with one arm, then the other, then with both together;
it is somewhat complicated, but no force
of habit can resist its good effect.</p>

<p>Another simpler flexion consists in first raising
and then lowering the arm, stretching it out in front
and behind, and at last turning it round and round,
the shoulder acting as a pivot. It is impossible to
see whether a pupil has too much stiffness in the
knees, but she can ascertain for herself by stretching
out both her feet in front and then bending
them as far back as they will go, and she may also
correct the same fault in her ankles by turning her
feet from left to right, from right to left, and up and
down, without moving the leg.</p>

<p>All this gymnastic practice must be done slowly,
quietly, and patiently, however tiresome it may seem,
as the result in the future will be of the greatest importance,
and it must also be done intelligently, for
the object is not to learn a certain number of movements,
but to gain flexibility and ease throughout
the body.</p>

<p>Parents can help a teacher considerably by making
children go through these flexions at home;
and it seems scarcely necessary to add that the
greatest care and discretion must be used in order
not to fatigue pupils, especially young girls.</p>

<p>When the teacher is satisfied that his pupil has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
overcome all nervousness and stiffness, so that she
feels at home in the saddle, he should explain to her
the details of the position during motion, and should
insist that she correct her faults without help from
him, in order that she may learn the quicker to take
the initiative and be responsible for herself.</p>

<p>Experience has shown me that it is easier for a
pupil to keep her shoulders on the same line, and sit
square, if she holds a rein in either hand; therefore
I recommend this method. And I have also found
that to learn by heart the following rules produces
excellent results, especially in cases where ladies
really wish to study, and to improve any bad habits
into which they may have fallen:</p>

<p><b>The head straight, easy, turning upon the
shoulders in every direction, without involving
the body in its movement.</b></p>

<p>If the head, being at the end of the spinal column,
is stiff, this stiffness will be communicated to
all the upper part of the body; if it can not turn
freely without making the shoulders turn also, the
stability of the seat will be impaired each time that
the head moves.</p>

<p><b>The eyes fixed straight to the front, looking
between the horse's ears, and always in
the direction in which he is going.</b></p>

<p>If the eyes are dropped, the head will tend to
droop forward, and little by little a habit of stooping
will be acquired, which will destroy the balance and
steadiness of the seat; while, if the rider does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
look out ahead, she may not be able to communicate
with her horse in time to avoid accidents&mdash;as he is
not supposed to know where he is going, and the
responsibility of guiding him rests with her.</p>

<p><b>The upper part of the body easy, flexible,
and straight.</b></p>

<p>If the upper part of the body is not easy, its stiffness
will extend to other parts which should be free
to give to the motion of the horse, and thus avoid
any shock; if it is not straight, the effect is lost of
the perpendicular line upon the horizontal one of the
horse's back, which corrects the displacement of equilibrium
when the animal is in motion.</p>

<p><b>The lower part of the body firm, without
stiffness.</b></p>

<p>If it were not firm, the spine would bend forward
or back from the perpendicular, and derange
the center of gravity, with dangerous results in case
the horse made a sudden bound; but there must be
no stiffness, as that detracts from the ease and suppleness
indispensable to a good seat.</p>

<p><b>The shoulders well back, and on the same
line.</b></p>

<p>Well back, in order to give the lungs full space
to breathe, and to prevent stooping. The most
common fault among ladies who ride is, that the
right shoulder is held farther forward than the left,
which is not only ungraceful, but bad for the horse,
as the rider's weight does not come evenly on his
back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The arms falling naturally, the elbows
being held close to the body without stiffness.</b></p>

<p>If the arms are held as if tied to the body, or if
the elbows are stuck out, the wrists and hands can
not guide the horse with ease.</p>

<p><b>The fore-arm bent.</b></p>

<p>Forming with the upper arm a right angle, of
which the elbow is the apex, in order to give the
wrist an intermediate position, whether the hand is
held high or low.</p>

<p><b>The wrists on a level with the elbows.</b></p>

<p>Because, if the wrists are held too low, the rider
will get into the habit of resting her hands on her
right knee, and will consequently neglect to occupy
herself with her horse's mouth.</p>

<p><b>Six inches apart.</b></p>

<p>In order to give the rider a fixed intermediary
position between the movements of the hands forward,
to the left, or to the right, by which she governs
her horse: if the wrists are held farther apart,
the elbows will appear pinioned to the sides; if nearer
together, the elbows, on the contrary, will stick
out in an angle.</p>

<p><b>The reins held in each hand.</b></p>

<p>I attach great importance to this disposition of
the reins, as it gives a novice confidence, makes it
easier for her to sit square in the saddle, and easier
also to manage her horse.</p>

<p><b>The fingers firmly closed, facing each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with the thumbs extended on the ends of the
reins.</b></p>

<p>The fingers should face each other, because, if
they are turned up or down, the elbows will get out
of position; and the reins must be held firmly and
kept from slipping by the thumb, as the horse will
be quick to take advantage if he feels the reins
lengthen whenever he moves his head.</p>

<p><b>The right foot falling naturally on the panel
of the saddle, the point forward and somewhat
down, and the right side of the leg held closely
to the saddle.</b></p>

<p>As the firmness of the seat depends greatly upon
a close hold of the pommel by the muscles of the
right knee, it is important that they should have as
free play as possible; and, if the foot is turned outward,
not only is the effect ungraceful, but the muscles
soon become fatigued and the whole position
constrained, even that of the right shoulder, which
will be held too far forward.</p>

<p><b>The left foot in the stirrup, without leaning
on it.</b></p>

<p>If a lady leans her weight on the stirrup, her natural
tendency will be to sit over too much to the left, which
may cause the saddle to turn, and is very hard on the
horse's back; besides, as she is out of equilibrium, any
sudden movement will shake her loose in her seat.</p>

<p><b>The point of the foot turned slightly to the
right, and the heel held lower than the rest of
the foot.</b></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>If the point is turned somewhat in, the whole leg
will rest more easily and closely against the saddle;
and, if the heel is lower than the ball of the foot, additional
contact of the leg will be gained, which is
important in managing a horse, and, when a spur is
worn, it will not be so apt to touch him at a wrong
time.</p>

<p><b>The part of the right leg between the knee
and the hip-joint should be turned on its outer
or right side, and should press throughout its
length on the saddle; while, on the contrary,
the inside of the left leg should be in permanent
contact with the saddle. The knees
should, in their respective positions, be continually
in contact, without any exception.
The lower or movable part of the leg plays
upon the immovable at the knee-joint, the sole
exception being when the rider rises to the
trot, at which time the upper part of the leg
leaves the saddle.</b></p>

<p>This position on horseback may be called academic,
or classical; and, from the beginning, a lady
should endeavor to obtain it, without, of course, becoming
discouraged if, for some time, she fails to
attain perfection.</p>

<p>I have met with excellent results by allowing my
pupils to leave this correct position, and then resume
it again, at first standing still, then at other
gaits progressively. "Progression" in horsemanship
means the execution of a movement at a trot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
or gallop after it has been learned and practiced at
a walk. In this way pupils soon become conscious
both of the right and the wrong seats, and the difference
between them, and it is consequently easy to
correct any detail in which they may find themselves
defective. I have done this in accordance with a
principle in which I firmly believe, i. e., that the
best teacher is he who soonest makes his pupil understand
what is expected of her, and how to accomplish
it. The former is theoretical, the latter
practical horsemanship, and there is a great difference
between them.</p>

<p>If the teacher finds it hard to make a pupil understand
the foregoing position, he may help her in
the following manner: He should take her right
foot, as indicated in the flexions, and, going as far
back as he can, place his right elbow on the horse's
croup, with his fore-arm perpendicular, and his fingers
open and bent backward. He will then request
the pupil to lean back until she feels the support of
the teacher's hand between her shoulders, and to
allow her head and shoulders to go back of their own
weight, when it will be easy for him, by pressure of
his hand, to straighten the body until it is in the correct
position. Some teachers adopt the Hungarian
method of passing a round stick through the arms
and behind the back; but this is only practicable
when a horse is standing still, or at a walk, and
even then great care should be used, as the rider
is quite helpless. It has also the disadvantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
making tall and slender persons hollow their backs
unduly.</p>

<p>Pupils should be warned to avoid, as much as
may be, clasping the pommel too tightly with the
right knee, as a constant strain will fatigue them
and take away the reserve force which they may
need at a given moment; indeed, a rider should be
taught from the first to economize his strength as
much as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as the pupil can sit her horse correctly,
at a walk, holding the reins in both hands, she should
practice holding them in the left hand only, in case
she should wish to use her right hand during the
lesson.</p>

<p>The English method of holding the reins of a
double bridle is, to bring all four up straight through
the fingers; for instance, the curb-reins, being outside,
go outside the little finger and between the
first and second fingers, while those of the snaffle
come between the fourth and middle and the middle
and first fingers.</p>

<p>In France and in this country the reins are crossed,
the curb being below, outside the little finger, and between
the third and middle fingers, while the snaffle
comes between the fourth and middle and the second
and first fingers.</p>

<p>The latter method seems to me preferable, as it
is easier to separate the reins, and also to regulate
the amount of tension required on one pair or the
other. In either position, the hand is held in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the body, with the palm and shut fingers toward
it, and the reins are held firmly in place by the pressure
of the thumb.</p>

<p>The teacher should explain that, as the curb is a
much more severe bit than the snaffle, its effects must
be used with delicacy, and he should give his pupils
plenty of practice in taking up, separating, and reuniting
the reins, in order that they may learn to
handle them quickly and with precision at any gait.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary">Exercises of pupils in private lessons&mdash;Words of command&mdash;Walking&mdash;Turning
to the right or left&mdash;Voltes and reversed
voltes&mdash;Trotting.</p>


<p class="p2">Although private lessons can not begin to take
the place of exercises in class, it is advisable that the
pupil should have some lessons by herself first, in order
that she may learn to manage her horse to some
extent at the walk, trot, and canter.</p>

<p>Words of command in the riding-school are of
two kinds; the first being preparatory, to enable
the pupil to think over quickly the means to be employed
in order to obey the second or final order.
Example: "Prepare to go forward"&mdash;preparatory.
"Go forward"&mdash;final order, given in a loud voice,
with emphasis on each word or syllable. Between
the two orders, the teacher should at first explain to
the pupil what is wanted, and the means of obtaining
it, and later should require her to repeat it herself,
so that she may learn it by heart. The teacher
commands the pupil, the pupil demands obedience
from the horse, and the horse executes the movement;
but this triple process needs time, all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
because a novice is likely to hesitate, even if she
makes no mistake. By giving the pupil time to
think, she will gain the habit of making progressive
demands on her horse, through means which she has
calculated, and she will thus gradually become a true
horsewoman, able to make her horse know what she
wants him to do; for, in almost every case, obstinacy
or resistance on the part of the horse comes
from the want of due progression between the demand
made of him and its execution.</p>

<p>When the teacher is satisfied that the pupil is in
a regular and easy position, before allowing her to
go forward, he will give her the directions necessary
to stop her horse, and will make sure that his explanation
has been understood. To stop: The horse
being at the walk, to stop him, the pupil should place
her leg and whip in contact with his sides, lift her
hands and bring them close to the body, and lean
her body back, drawing herself up. When the horse
has come to a stand-still, she should resume the normal
position. To go forward: The whip and leg
should be placed in contact, the hands moved forward,
and the body inclined also forward.</p>

<p>When the pupil has a clear idea of these movements,
the teacher will give the orders:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to go forward.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Forward.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And, after some steps have been taken,</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to stop.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Stop.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While making his pupils advance at a walk, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
teacher will explain succinctly the mechanism of
locomotion.</p>

<p>The horse at rest is said to be square on his base
when his four legs are perpendicular between two
parallels, one being the horizontal line of the ground,
the other the corresponding line of his back. If his
hind legs are outside of this square, he is said to be
"campé," or planted, because he can neither move
forward nor back unless he changes this position.
If his fore legs are outside this line, he is "campé"
in front, as, for instance, when kicking; if, on the
contrary, his fore legs are inside his base, he is said
to be "under himself" in front; and it is a bad sign
when a horse takes this position habitually, as it
shows fatigue or weakness in those limbs.</p>

<p>The horse goes forward, backward, trots or gallops,
by a contraction of the muscles of the hind
quarters, the duty of the fore legs being to support
his weight and get out of the way of the hind ones;
and the whole art of riding consists in a knowledge of
the means which give the rider control of these muscular
contractions of the hind quarters. The application
of the left leg and of the whip on the sides of
the horse serve to make him go forward, backward,
to the right or left, and the reins serve to guide and
support him, and also to indicate the movement required
by the whip and leg.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to turn to the right.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Turn to the right.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To turn her horse to the right, the pupil should
draw her right hand back and to the right, incline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
her body also to the right, turning her head in the
same direction, and use her whip lightly, without
stopping the pressure of her left leg. When her
horse has turned far enough, she will cease pressure
on the right side, and carry her horse straight forward.</p>

<p>In the beginning, regularity of movement is not
so important as that the pupil should understand the
means by which she executes it; that is to say, that
she disturbs the equilibrium of her horse by carrying
the weight of her body to the right; and, while her
hand and whip combine on that side, the left leg
prevents him from stopping or straggling over the
ground.</p>

<p>Riders in a school are said to be on the right
hand when the right side of the body is toward the
middle of the ring; and this is the easier way for
inexperienced pupils, because they are less shaken
when their horses move to the right, as they sit on
the left side of their saddles.</p>

<p>It follows, naturally, that to be on the left hand is
to have the left side toward the middle; and, when
riding on the right hand, all movements are executed
to the right, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The teacher must watch carefully that pupils do
not allow their horses to turn the corners of their
own accord, as a regular movement to the right
should be executed by the pupil at each corner when
riding on the right hand, and to the left when going
the other way.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>If left to guide himself around a school, the horse
will describe a sort of oval, rounding the corners, instead
of going into them, and thus much valuable
practice is lost to the rider.</p>

<p>The pupil being at a walk, and on the right hand,
the teacher will give the word of command:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to trot.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Trot.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To make her horse trot, she must advance her
wrists, lean the body forward, and use the leg and
whip, resuming the normal position as soon as her
horse obeys her.</p>

<p>In order not to fatigue the pupil, the teacher will
only allow her to trot a short distance, and will remind
her to keep her right foot well back and close
to the saddle, and to sit close without stiffness. He
will also take care that she passes from the walk to
the trot gradually, by making her horse walk faster
and faster until he breaks into a slow trot.</p>

<p>Each time that a pupil changes from a slow to a
faster gait, she should accelerate the former as much
as possible, and begin the latter slowly, increasing
the speed gradually up to the desired point; and the
same rule holds good, reversing the process, if she
wishes to change from a fast to a slower gait.</p>

<p>As the pupil gains confidence, and feels at home
in the trot, the teacher will let her practice it at
shorter intervals, and for a longer time, taking care,
however, that she does not attempt to rise to it;
if she loses the correct position, she must come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to a walk, and, having corrected her fault, resume
the trot.</p>

<p>In the intervals of rest, in order not to lose time,
the pupil should repeat at a walk the movements
which she has learned already, the teacher becoming
gradually more exacting in regard to the correctness
of the positions and effects, adding also the
three following movements, which are more complicated,
and which complete the series, dealing with
changes of direction.</p>

<p>The volte is a circular movement, executed by
the horse upon a curved line, not less than twelve
of his steps in length. The pupil being at a walk,
and on the right hand of the school, the teacher will
say:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to volte.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Volte</i>,</p></blockquote>

<p>explaining that the pupil should direct her horse to
the right, exactly as if she merely meant to turn him
in that direction, continuing, however, the same position,
and using the same effects, until the twelve
paces have been taken, which will bring her to the
point of beginning, when she will resume the normal
position, and go forward on the same hand.</p>

<p>The half-volte, as its name implies, comprises the
first part of the movement, the pupil coming back to
her place by a diagonal line.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to half-volte.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Half-volte.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The pupil uses the same effects as in the volte,
but, when she has described half the circle, she re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>turns
to her starting-point by a diagonal, using the
same effects, but with much less force, since, to regain
her place by the diagonal, she will only have one
fourth of a turn to the right to make; then, at the
end of the diagonal, she must change her effects
completely, in order to execute three fourths of a
turn to the left, which will bring her back to her
track, but on the left hand.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare for the reversed half-volte.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Reversed
half-volte.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To make her horse execute a reversed half-volte,
the pupil uses the same means and effects as in the
preceding movement, exactly reversing them at the
end; that is to say, when on the diagonal, about six
paces from her track, she makes a half-circle to the
left, following the rules prescribed for the volte.</p>

<p>The teacher must be careful to explain that, in
the voltes, the pupil does not change the direction in
which she is going, because she describes a circle;
but in the half-volte, if she is on the right hand at
the beginning, she will be on the left at the end. He
must also see that her horse executes all these movements
at a steady pace; and, if she will practice
faithfully these different changes of direction, with
the positions and effects which govern them, she will,
in time, acquire the habit of guiding her horse
promptly and skillfully in any direction.</p>

<p><i>To go backward.</i>&mdash;The pupil, being at a stand-still,
the teacher will give the word of command:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to back.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Explanation.</i>&mdash;To make her horse go backward,
the pupil should draw herself up and lean back very
far, using her leg and whip together, in order to
bring the horse's legs well under him, and at the
same time raise both wrists and bring them near the
body. As soon as the horse has taken his first step
backward, the pupil should stop the action of her
leg, whip, and hands, only to resume them almost
immediately to determine the second step; to stop
backing, she will stop all effects, and resume the normal
positions.</p>

<p>After a few steps, the teacher should say:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to stop backing.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Stop backing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The movement is only correct when the horse
backs in a straight line, and step by step. If he
quickens his movement, he must be at once carried
vigorously forward with the leg and whip.</p>

<p>When the pupil begins to have a firm seat at the
trot, the teacher will gradually let her pass the corners
at that gait, and, at his discretion, will also let
her execute some of the movements to the right and
left. To do this, she will use precisely the same
means as at the walk, the only difference being that,
as the gait is quicker, the changes of equilibrium are
greater for both horse and rider, and the effects
should be lighter and more quickly employed and
stopped.</p>

<p>I have given most of the movements to the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to avoid useless repetition, but they should be frequently
reversed; and care must always be taken to
avoid over-fatigue.</p>

<p>When the teacher is fully satisfied that his pupil
has advanced far enough to profit by it, he may begin
to teach her to rise at the trot; but he must not
be in too great a hurry to reach this point, and he
must make her understand that to rise is the result
of a good seat, and that a good seat does <i>not</i> result
from rising.</p>

<p>For the last fifteen years I have looked in vain, in
all the treatises on riding, for the reason of that rising
to the action of the horse known as the "English
trot," and yet I have seen it practiced among races
ignorant of equestrian science, who ride from childhood
as a means of getting from one place to another.
The Arabs, Cossacks, Turks, Mexicans, and Apaches,
all employ it, in a fashion more or less precise and
rhythmical, rising whether their stirrups are short or
long, and even if they have none. It is certain that
this way of neutralizing the reaction spares and helps
the horse; and it was calculated, at the meeting of
the "Equestrian Committee" at Paris, in 1872, that
each time a rider rises he relieves the horse's back
of one third of the weight which must rest on it permanently
if he sits fast; and since that time rising
at the trot has been practiced in all the cavalry of
Europe.</p>

<p>After the siege of Paris, in 1871, I was obliged to
undertake the training of the horses of my regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which was then stationed at Massy. These horses
were all young and unbroken; and, as a result of
their youth and the fatigues they had undergone,
they were in poor condition, and nearly all had sore
backs. I directed all the teachers who were under
me, and the men who rode the horses during their
training, to rise at the trot; and, three months later,
the young horses were in perfect health, while their
riders, who had been exhausted by a severe campaign,
had gained on an average seven pounds in
weight; and it was this experiment which was submitted
by me to the "Equestrian Committee."</p>

<p>I was tempted to make this digression, which I
hope will be forgiven me, because I have heard in
this country a great deal of adverse and, in my opinion,
unjust criticism of the English trot, which I
ascribe to the neglect of teachers, and the indifference
of ladies brought up in the old school of riding
to prefer horses which cantered all the time, or were
broken to artificial gaits, like racking and pacing.</p>

<p>The rider who wishes to rise to the trot should
be careful that the stirrup is not so short as to keep
her left leg in constant contact with the third pommel,
or leaping-horn, as, unless there is the space of
three or four fingers between the pommel and the
leg, the latter may be bruised, and the rider forced
down too soon.</p>

<p>In order to explain this movement, the teacher
may proceed as follows: Placing himself at the left
side of the horse, he will ask the pupil to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
reins in her left hand and put her right hand on the
first pommel, with the thumb inside and the palm of
the hand on the pommel; he will then take her left
foot in his left hand, in order to prevent her from
pushing it forward, explaining that, by pressing on
the stirrup, she will develop the obtuse angle formed
by her leg, of which the knee is the apex; whereas,
if she pushes her foot forward, the angle will cease
to exist, and she can not lift herself. With his right
hand placed under her left arm, he will help her to
lift herself perpendicularly; while she is in the air
he will count one, will let her pause there for a short
space of time, and will then help her to let herself
slowly down, continuing the pressure on the stirrup,
and, when she has regained her saddle, he will count
two; then he will recommence the movement of rising,
and will count three while she is in the air, and
four when she is again seated; and this may be
continued until he sees that she is beginning to be
tired. The foot must only be one third of its length
in the stirrup; for, if it is pushed home, she will
lose the play of the ankle, which will tend to stiffen
the knee and hip. When the pupil begins to understand,
the teacher will let her go through the movement
rather more quickly, still counting one, two,
three, four; then he will allow her to practice it
without his help: all this preparatory work being
done while the horse is standing still. It is important
that she should not drop into her saddle, but
let herself down by pressing on the stirrup; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
no account should the right knee cease to be in contact
with the second pommel, as this is the sole case
in which the lower part of this leg is motionless while
the upper part moves. As soon as the pupil can rise
without too much effort, and tolerably quickly, she
may practice it at the walk, and then at the trot,
counting for herself, one, two, three, four; and she
must put a certain amount of energy into it, for all
the theory in the world will not teach her to rise in
time with the horse unless she also helps herself.
The theory of the rhythmical cadence is easy enough
to give: the rider rises when the horse takes one
step, and sinks back at the second, to rise again at
the third; but the cadence itself is not so easy to
find; and to rise at the wrong step is like beginning
on the wrong beat of a waltz. Many young persons
get into the bad habit of lowering the right knee
when they rise, and lifting it when they regain their
seat; but this is a mistake, as the right knee should
be immovable, and in constant contact with the second
pommel.</p>

<p>As soon as the pupil has struck the cadence (and,
once found, it comes easily afterward), she should
discontinue the use of her right hand on the pommel,
and the teacher may be more exacting as to
the regularity of her position than is necessary in
her first efforts. During rising to the trot, the upper
part of the body should be very slightly bent forward;
and, if the teacher notices that the pupil is
rising from right to left, or left to right, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
perpendicularly, he should make her put the fingers
of her right hand on the top of her saddle behind,
and thus give herself a little help in rising, until she
gets used to it. Each time that the rider wishes to
make her horse trot, she should sit close while he
changes from a walk to a trot, and until he is trotting
as fast as is necessary, because he does not
arrive at that speed instantly, but by hurrying his
steps, so that there is no regular cadence of the trot
to which she can rise; and she should follow the
same rule when she makes him slacken his pace
before coming to a walk.</p>

<p>The teacher must be careful to see that the hands
do not follow the movements of the body, as they
must keep quite still, the arms moving at the elbow.</p>

<p>There is not, nor can there be, any approximate
calculation of the height to rise, as that depends
entirely upon the gait of the horse. If he takes
short steps, the rider must rise oftener, and consequently
not so high; but, if he is long-gaited, she
must rise high, in order not to get back into the
saddle before he is ready to take his second step.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary">Classes&mdash;Successive and individual movements&mdash;The gallop&mdash;Leaping&mdash;Suggestions
for riding on the road.</p>


<p class="p2">When the pupil has taken from ten to fifteen lessons,
she ought to be able to execute the movements
she has studied with a certain degree of correctness,
and to remain a full hour on horseback without fatigue;
and she should then, if possible, be placed in
a class composed of not less than twelve nor more
than twenty-four members. Children in a class
should be of the same sex, and, as near as may be,
of the same age and equestrian experience. It is
not necessary that the class should meet every day;
it may come together one, two, or three times a week,
under the guidance of the same teacher, and this
need not prevent a pupil who is in it from coming to
the school at other times to practice the various
movements by herself.</p>

<p>All concerned should do their best to have all
the members of the class present, and the school
should be kept clear of other riders during such
classes. The presence of spectators is objectionable,
particularly where there is a class of young girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Granted that they are the parents, for instance, of
one or two of the pupils: to the rest they are strangers,
who cause constraint, as the teacher is obliged
to criticise, correct, and, in a word, instruct, in a
loud voice, so that the observation made to one
may serve as a suggestion to all.</p>

<p>The difference of progress between classes and
individual pupils is so great that one may calculate
that, after one hundred private lessons, a pupil will
not ride so well as if she had taken fifty lessons in
class. In a class she is obliged to keep her horse at
a certain distance from the others, and in his own
place, and, in her turn, go through exercises directed
by a will other than her own, while the constant
repetition of principles by the teacher fixes them in
her memory. On the other hand, the private pupil
takes her time to make her horse go through a movement;
and, that movement once understood, there is
no reason for the repetition of the explanations which
can alone make the theory and principle of riding
familiar. I am certainly not an advocate for theory
without practice; but I insist that a rider must know
what she ought to do before she can do it really well,
as all good results in riding are obtained by long
practice, based on a rational theory.</p>

<p>The teacher should choose out of his class the
four most skillful pupils, whose horses are free and
regular in their gaits, to serve as leaders, one at the
head and one at the end of the two columns, which
should be drawn up on the long sides of the school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
each rider having a space of at least three feet between
the head of her horse and the tail of the one
in front of her, the heads of the leaders' horses being
about six feet from the corner of the school. While
the columns are standing still, the teacher should
explain distinctly the difference between distance and
interval, and he had better be on foot at the end of
the school, facing the columns.</p>

<p>By "distance" is meant the space between the tail
of one horse and the head of the next in the column.</p>

<p>"Interval" is the space between two horses who
are standing or going forward on parallel lines.</p>

<p>All movements are executed singly or in file: in
the first case each pupil goes through the movement,
without regard to the others; in the second, the
pupils execute the movement in turn after the leaders
of the column.</p>

<p>A movement in file, once known, may be repeated
individually, but only at a walk in the beginning,
in order to insure attention. The columns should
both be on the right hand; consequently the head
of one will be opposite the end of the other as
they are drawn up on their respective sides. First
order:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to go forward.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Go forward.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When the final word of command is given, the pupils
will advance simultaneously, each one using the
same effects as if she were alone, and being careful
to preserve the correct distance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The two leaders should so regulate the gait of
their horses as to pass the opposite corners of the
school at the same moment, and this gait should be
uniform. If a pupil loses her distance, she should
regain it by making her horse walk faster; but she
should try to keep her place, as the whole column
must quicken its pace when she does, and all suffer
from the carelessness of one.</p>

<p>When the columns are on the short sides of the
school, the teacher should give the order:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to halt</i>;</p></blockquote>

<p>and when they are on the long side,</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Halt.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When they are again going forward, always on
the right hand, the order should be given:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to turn to the right.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Turn to the right.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>At the final order each pupil will turn to the right
on her own account, and according to the rules already
prescribed; at the end of this movement all
will find themselves on parallel lines, and about
twelve feet apart; they should then turn the head
somewhat to the right, in order to see that they are
on the same line, and cross the width of the school
in such a way that the columns will meet and pass
each other in the middle. When they have reached
the opposite side, they will turn to the right without
further order, the leaders at the end of the column
being now at its head. This movement should <i>never</i>
be executed except at a walk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>To replace the columns in their accustomed order,
the teacher should have this movement executed a
second time. When the columns are going forward
on the right hand, the order will be given:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to volte in file.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In this movement the same principles and the
same means are used as in a private lesson; the
leaders, however, describe a larger circle proportionate
to the length of their columns, and at the end
their horses' heads should be about three feet behind
the tails of the last horses in their respective
columns. The other pupils then, in turn, execute
the movement upon the same ground as the leader.
The leaders having moved two thirds down one of
the long sides, the teacher will order:</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Volte in file</i>;</p></blockquote>

<p>and, when the columns are again going forward on
the right hand,</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to half-volte in file.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The leaders turn to the right, describe their half-circle,
and go forward on a diagonal line ending just
behind the last rider in the column; once there, they
turn to the left and fall into line, being duly followed
by each pupil over the same ground.</p>

<p>When the leaders are about eighteen feet from
the corner of the school, the teacher will order:</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Half-volte in file.</i></p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The next order should be:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare for the reversed half-volte in file.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The leaders must execute diagonals proportional
to the lengths of their respective columns, in such a
manner as will enable them to begin their half-circles
when about thirty feet down the long sides, and
thirty-five or forty feet before the turn or corner,
followed in turn by the other pupils, as in the foregoing
movements.</p>

<p>As soon as the leaders are on the long sides, having
passed the second corners, the teacher will order:</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Reversed half-volte in file.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The columns being on the long sides, and on the
right hand, the next order should be:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to back.</i>&mdash;2. <i>Back.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And, to execute this movement correctly, each
pupil will make her horse back as she would in a
private lesson, being careful to keep in a line with
her companions.</p>

<p>When the class can execute these movements
correctly at a walk, the teacher will allow them to
be practiced at a trot, insisting, however, that the
pupils shall stop rising as soon as the preparatory
order is given, not to begin again until they have
returned to the side of the school at the end of the
movement. When there is a full class, it is better
not to allow turns to the right or left to be attempted
at a trot, as the riders may strike one another's knees
in crossing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>When these movements in file, at the walk and
the trot, have given the pupils the habit of controlling
their horses with decision and regularity, the
teacher should explain to them the difference between
these and individual movements. The column
being at a walk, and on the right hand, the
teacher will say:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to volte singly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Each pupil leaves the line at the same moment
as the others, executes a circular line of twelve steps
as in a private lesson, and takes her place in the line
again.</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Volte singly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Next in order comes:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <i>Prepare to half-volte singly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is done exactly as in a private lesson, the
pupils taking care to do it in time with one another,
in order to reach their places at the same moment.</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Half-volte singly.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Prepare for the reversed half-volte singly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The pupils leave their places simultaneously by
a diagonal line, and return to the same track; but,
on the other hand, by a circular line of six steps.</p>

<blockquote><p>2. <i>Reversed half-volte singly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>These movements are here given on the right
hand; but they may, of course, be done equally well
on the left hand by reversing the terms.</p>

<p>I recommend teachers not to keep their pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
too long on the left hand, but to seize that opportunity
to rectify any incorrect positions of the feet.</p>

<p>When the class can execute the foregoing movements
correctly at the walk and the trot, the teacher
may explain to them the canter or gallop.</p>

<p>A horse is said to "lead" at a canter with his
right foot when the lateral movement of his right
foot is more marked than that of his left. This
causes a reaction from left to right, which makes
this lead easier for a lady, who sits on the left side,
than that of the left foot, where the reaction is from
right to left. When a horse who is leading with his
right foot turns to the left, he must change his lead,
and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>To make her horse lead at a canter with his right
foot, the rider must put her left leg very far back to
act in opposition with her whip, which should make
very light attacks, incline the upper part of her body
forward, and lift her hands, without, however, drawing
them nearer her body. When the horse has
obeyed, she will resume the normal position for
hands and body, renewing the pressure of her whip
and leg from time to time to keep the gait regular.
During the canter or gallop the right foot should be
held well back, close to the saddle, without rigidity,
and the rider should sit firm in her saddle, while allowing
the upper part of her body to give freely to the
motion of the horse, in order to neutralize any shock.
To change his lead from right to left at a gallop, the
horse pauses for an imperceptible space of time, im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>mediately
puts his left hind leg in front of his right,
and, by the contraction of the muscles of his left leg,
projects his body forward to the left, his equilibrium
being again disturbed, but in a new direction; to
compensate which, his left fore leg comes at the first
step to support the weight by putting itself before
the right, which, until then, has been carrying it all.</p>

<p>It requires a great deal of tact, the result of long
practice, to make a horse change his feet when he is
galloping in a straight line, and I therefore recommend
teachers to proceed with their classes in the
following manner:</p>

<p>The column being at a gallop, each pupil should
execute a half-volte in file, turning at the gallop, coming
down to a trot on the diagonal, and resuming the
gallop when she is on the opposite track and on the
other hand. As the horse is galloping with his right
foot, the rider will calculate the movement of his
right shoulder by watching it without lowering her
head, and, when she sees that shoulder move to put
down the right leg, she must instantly change her
effects of leg and whip, and lift her hands, the right
rather more than the left, to support the horse while
he pauses with his right shoulder, while an energetic
action of her leg will make him bring his left hind
leg under him and put it in front of the right; and, if
she holds her left hand low, the left fore leg will be
free to take its place in front of the right. Care
must be taken not to throw a horse while he is
changing his feet, that is to say, he must not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
turned suddenly to the right in order to be jerked
suddenly to the left; and, during the short time which
it takes him to change his feet, the rider should sit
close in order not to disturb him by a shifting
weight.</p>

<p>When the pupils can make their horses change
their feet by changing their gait, they should be made
to execute half-voltes and reversed half-voltes in file,
at a gallop, without changing to a trot; and, when
they can do this, they may execute them individually,
according to the rules already prescribed.</p>

<p>I must again recommend great prudence, that
accidents may be avoided, and plenty of pauses for
rest, that the horses may not become discouraged.</p>

<p>A lady's equestrian education can not be considered
complete until she can make her horse leap
any obstacle which is reasonable, considering her age
and experience and the capacity of her horse. When
her seat has become flexible and firm at the walk,
trot, and gallop, when she is mistress of her horse in
changes of direction, of gait, and of feet, the teacher
should allow her to leap a hurdle not less than two
nor more than three feet high.</p>

<p>The class being formed into a single column,
close together, each rider should make an individual
turn to the right on the long side of the school opposite
where the hurdle is to be placed, as she can thus
see for herself any faults which may be committed by
her companions. Leaping should be practiced by the
pupils one at a time, at a walk, a trot, and, finally, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
gallop. The class being drawn up in line, the teacher
will proceed to explain to them the animal mechanism
of the leap.</p>

<p>If a horse is at a walk, and wishes to jump over
an obstacle, he draws his hind legs under him to
support his weight, pauses for an instant, then lifts
his fore legs from the ground, thus throwing all his
weight upon his hind legs; whereupon, by a powerful
contraction of the muscles, these latter project
his body forward and upward, and it describes a
curve through the air, alighting on the fore legs,
braced to receive the shock, the hind legs dropping
on the ground in their turn, only to contract again
sufficiently to form a forward motion.</p>

<p>The pause before a leap is more noticeable at a
walk than at a trot, and least of all at a gallop. The
most favorable gait for leaping is what is known as
a hand-gallop, which is an intermediate pace between
a riding-school canter and the full gallop of
the race-track, as, while he is at this gait, the horse
is impelled forward with his hind legs constantly
under him.</p>

<p>In order to aid and support her horse at a leap,
the rider should bring him straight up to the obstacle
at a slow and regular gait, and should put her own
right foot very far back, that she may make her seat
as firm as possible; at the moment when he pauses
she should lean back and lift both of her hands a
little, in order to enter into the slight approach to
rearing, without encouraging it too much; then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
soon as she feels the horse project himself forward,
she must give her hand, straighten herself, and lean
back as the horse goes over, lifting her wrists with
energy as soon as he touches the ground. When he
has begun the motion of rearing, a simultaneous action
of the whip and leg will help to determine his leap.</p>

<p>It may be noticed that I use the words "aid"
and "support" instead of "<i>make</i>," and also that I
indicate first the positions of the body, next of the
hands, and last the effects of the leg and whip, to
the end that the pupil may not be confused as to
the very short time in which these latter may be
rightly used. Before leaping, the teacher may allow
the pupils to practice their positions in the following
manner:</p>

<p>He should make them count one, leaning the
body and drawing the wrists backward; two, the
body and wrists forward; three, the body and wrists
backward again. This series, slow in the beginning,
may be quickened little by little until it is as near as
may be to the speed necessary in these movements
during the short duration of a leap.</p>

<p>When the pupils have gone through these motions
intelligently, the teacher will take his place in
front and to the right of the hurdle, facing the wall.
The hurdle should always be placed in the middle
of one of the long sides; and ladies prefer to jump
on the left hand, in order to avoid touching the wall
with their legs if the horse should go too near it.
Notwithstanding this, if the horses are free jumpers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and the school well arranged, I prefer the right
hand, because a fall to the right is then clear of the
wall. This is a case in which an instructor must
depend upon his own judgment.</p>

<p>The teacher stands as I have indicated above,
holding a whip with a long lash, not to strike the
horses, but to prevent refusals.</p>

<p>One after another the pupils should leave the
line, and advance at a walk, until they get on
the side of the school where the hurdle has been
placed, when they will canter, but without any excitement;
and they will find it useful to count one,
two, three, until the three movements of the body
have become mechanical from practice.</p>

<p>During the course of the more advanced lessons,
it will still be useful to practice some flexions, in order
to be sure that pupils keep supple. They should
also learn to take the foot out of the stirrup at any
gait, and replace it without stopping, and to rise at
the trot, the foot being out of the stirrup, which is
not so difficult as it appears. They should also be
drilled to walk, trot, or gallop by twos and threes, to
learn to accommodate their horses' gait to that of a
companion. The teacher should be sure that, at the
end of their lessons, the pupils can trot or gallop for
at least a mile without stopping; and, to gain this
result, he must proceed by degrees, with the object
of developing the lungs and giving a freer respiration.
Nothing is more ridiculous than to see a
rider, who has proposed a trot or canter to her com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>panion,
obliged to pull up after a few steps, puffing
and panting for breath. She is apt to ruin her own
horse; and gentlemen who have spirited animals are
likely to avoid riding with her. Except in the prescribed
effects of the whip and leg, there is no definite
position in which a lady is obliged to hold her
whip, and she should learn to carry it as suits her
best. She should be able to arrange her skirt while
at a walk, without assistance, and also to shorten or
lengthen her stirrup by the strap on the right side of
the saddle, without taking her foot out.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of the lessons the teacher
should suppress all the little chirpings and clackings
of the tongue, which, however useful they may
be to a coachman or a horse-trainer, are out of
place in the mouth of a lady. I was once invited
to accompany a lady in Central Park, in New York;
and, as I had been told that she rode very well, I
did not hesitate to ride Général, a noble animal,
whose education in the <i>haute école</i> I was just finishing.
We started. She managed her horse with
her tongue as an effect on the right side, instead
of using her whip. The consequence was, that
my horse, hearing these appeals, and not knowing
whether they were meant for him or not, remained
at the <i>passage</i> all the way from the gate to the reservoir,
where I took it upon myself to beg her to do
as she chose with her own horse, but to allow mine
to be under my own control.</p>

<p>I recommend not giving dainties to horses be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>fore
mounting, unless they are allowed time to eat
them. If a horse has a piece of sugar or apple in his
mouth, the bit will be worse than useless; it will
irritate him, as he can not open his mouth without
dropping the delicacy, and he can not swallow it if
he gives his head properly.</p>

<p>I have noticed that most gentlemen riding with
ladies place themselves on the right side; but this
seems to me a mistake, where the rule of the road is
to pass to the right, because it is the lady who protects
her companion, and not he who shields her.
Besides, he takes the place where his horse is most
likely to be quiet, as no one has the right to pass
inside him. Still further, should the lady's horse
become frightened, he will be seriously embarrassed
on the right side, with the reins in his left hand;
and, if she should fall, what can he do? He can
only transfer his reins to the right hand, and endeavor
to push her into her saddle with his left;
and, if they are going fast, this will not be easy.</p>

<p>I may say here, that in ninety-five cases out of
a hundred the lady falls to the right. If the gentleman
is riding on her left, he gives up to her the best
place, and protects her legs; she can use her whip
more freely; he has the use of his right hand to
stop or quiet her horse; he can arrange her skirt,
should she need his help; if she falls, he has but to
seize her left arm, and draw her toward him, calculating
the strength which he employs, and he may
even lift her from the saddle.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chapt-summary">Resistances of the horse.</p>


<p class="p2">In all the best riding-schools of Europe two posts
are firmly fixed into the ground, parallel with and
about twenty paces from one of the short sides of
the school. These are called pillars, and between
them is fastened a horse who is trained to rear or to
kick at command, in order that the teacher may explain
to his pupils what they must do when they
encounter one or other of these resistances. These
pillars are almost unknown in riding-schools in this
country, and the reason of their absence may be
found, I think, in the moral qualities of the American
horse, which are really astonishing when looked
at from the point of view of animal character.</p>

<p>A teacher should, however, give his pupils some
instructions about the most common tricks or vices
of the horse, which are usually only defensive action
on his part. Before any active form of resistance,
the horse always makes a well-marked pause; for
instance, in order to rear, he stops his motion forward,
draws his hind legs under him, throws his
weight on them, and lifts his fore legs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ground, holding his head high. When he is almost
upright on his hind legs, he stands for a longer or
shorter time, moving his fore feet as if beating the
air, and then either comes down to earth again or
falls backward, which is acknowledged to be the
most dangerous thing which can happen on horseback.
If the rider feels that her horse is on the
point of going over with her, she must instantly slip
her foot out of the stirrup, loosen the hold of her leg
on the pommel, and lean as far to the right as she
can, turning her body to the left in order to fall on
the right of the horse, who almost always falls to the
left, and, as soon as she is on the ground, she must
scramble away from her horse as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The best way of preventing a horse from rearing
is not allowing him to stop; and, if it should be too
late or too difficult to manage this, all effects of the
hands should stop at once, and the rider should
attack his right flank with her whip vigorously. If
a horse rears habitually, he should be got rid of.</p>

<p>In order to kick, on the contrary, the horse braces
himself with his fore legs, lifting his hind quarters by
a contraction of his hind legs; and, when his croup
is in the air, he kicks as hard as he can with his hind
legs, and brings them suddenly to the ground again,
holding his head low and sticking out his neck meanwhile.</p>

<p>An inexperienced rider may be frightened by the
shock of this movement, which is very disagreeable,
besides being dangerous to people behind; but, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
calm presence of mind and a little energy, this trick
may be fought without too much annoyance. In
this case also the great thing is to hinder the horse
from stopping, by keeping his head up; and, if, in
spite of the rider, he gets it down and his legs braced
in front of him, she should lean very far back and
strike one or two vigorous blows with her whip on
the lower part of the neck where it joins the chest,
trying at the same time to lift the head with the reins.</p>

<p>Some teachers recommend using the whip on the
flank, as in rearing, and I usually do this myself;
but I have always noticed that the horse kicks again
at least once while going forward; so I do not recommend
this for a lady.</p>

<p>In bucking, the horse puts his head down, stiffens
his fore legs, draws his hind legs somewhat under
him, and jumps forward, coming down on all four
feet at once, and jumping again almost immediately.</p>

<p>Without being particularly dangerous, this vice is
very unpleasant, as it jars the rider terribly. To neutralize
the shock, therefore, as much as she can, she
must sit very far back, lean her body back, lift her
hands vigorously, and try to make her horse go forward
and slightly to the right.</p>

<p>When a horse refuses to slacken his pace, or to
stop when his rider wishes it, he is running away
with her, and he does this progressively&mdash;that is, if he
is at a walk he will not stop when he feels the bit, but
shakes his head, quickens his pace to a trot, throws
his head into the air, or holds it down, bearing against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the bit, breaks into a gallop, and goes faster and
faster until he is at full speed; and, once arrived at
this point, he is quite capable of running straight into
a wall or jumping over a precipice.</p>

<p>Some high authorities maintain that this state of
the horse is one of temporary insanity; and this theory
is admissible in certain cases where, when the animal
is stopped, the nostrils are found to be very red
and the eyes bloodshot; but, in most cases, horses
run away through sudden fright, or from fear of punishment,
or because they are in pain from one cause
or another. When a horse is subject to this fault,
his rider should give him to a man, either a skilled
amateur or a professional rider, as I have seen very
few ladies who could undertake the proper treatment
without danger.</p>

<p>Such a horse being put into my hands for training,
I take him to some place where the footing is
good and where he can have plenty of space, which
means plenty of time for me; and, once there, I provoke
him to run away, in order that I may find out
why he does so. If he fights against my hand, shuts
his mouth, or throws his head in the air, as soon as he
has stopped I carefully examine his mouth, his throat,
his breathing, his sight, his loins, and his houghs.
Sometimes the mouth is without saliva, the lips are
rough and irritated, the bars are dry, bruised, and
even cut; and in that case I try to see whether the
bad habit does not come from severe bitting, or too
tight a curb-chain, or perhaps the teeth may be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
bad order. A few flexions of the jaw and neck will
tell me at once if the mouth is the cause of the
trouble; but I must make sure that this bad state of
the mouth is the cause, and not the consequence.</p>

<p>The sight of a horse is often defective; the sun
in his eyes dazzles and frightens him; or else a defective
lens makes objects appear larger to him than
they really are; or he may be near-sighted, and consequently
nervous about what he can not see; and
a moving bird, or a bit of floating paper, is enough
to make him bolt.</p>

<p>Sometimes the throat is sore inside, and then the
horse suffers from the effect of the bit on the extremity
of his neck when he gives his head. Bolting
is often caused by suffering in some internal organ;
and in that case the breathing is apt to be oppressed.</p>

<p>But in seven cases out of ten the cause of a
horse's running away is to be found in his hind
quarters. The loins are too long, weak, and ill-attached,
so that when he carries a heavy weight the
spinal column feels an insupportable pain. What
man would not become mad if he were forced to
walk, trot, and gallop, carrying a weight which caused
him frightful suffering? The remembrance of an
old wound made by the saddle is sometimes enough
to cause a nervous and sensitive animal to bolt. The
legs are sometimes beginning to throw out curbs or
spavins, or they may be too straight and narrow,
lacking the strength necessary to carry the horse at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
a regular gait; so he suffers, loses his head, and runs
away.</p>

<p>We will suppose the horse to be well-proportioned,
with his sight and organs in a normal condition,
his mouth only being hurt as a consequence,
not as a cause. I change the bit, and substitute an
easier one, treating the mouth meanwhile with salt,
or alum, or marsh-mallow; and yet my horse still runs
away. In that case it is from one of two reasons:
either it is from memory and as a habit, or else it is
the result of ill-temper. If the former, I take him
to some spot where I can have plenty of space and
time, preferably a sea-beach with soft sand, or a large
ploughed field; and there I let him go, stopping when
he stops, and then making him go on again, and in
this way he soon learns that submission is the easiest
way for him. If he should be really ill-tempered,
I would mount him in the same place with sharp
spurs and a good whip, and before long his moral
condition would be much more satisfactory.</p>

<p>But often a horse takes fright and runs away when
one least expects it. Allow me to say that nothing
which a horse can do should ever be unexpected.
On horseback one should be ready for emergencies;
and the best way to avoid them is to prevent the
horse from a dangerous initiative. Besides, the
horse does not get to his full speed at once; and, if
the rider keeps calm, she will probably be able to
master him before he reaches it. But, if, in spite of
herself, her horse is running at a frightful pace, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
should be done? In the first place, she must try to see
that he does not slip and fall; and, in any case, she
should take her foot out of the stirrup, let her whip
drop if necessary, choose at once a straight line, if
that be possible, and give to her horse with hands
and leg, calming him with the voice, and speaking
loud, in order that it may reach his ear. She should
endeavor to remain calm, and to take long breaths;
then, when his first rush is over, she should lift her
wrists, holding the reins short, lean very far back,
and saw his mouth vigorously with the bridle, two
reins being in either hand. "Sawing" is the successive
action of the two hands acting separately
on the mouth of the horse, and, by pulling his head
from side to side, it throws him out of his stride and
checks his speed. I can not say too often that it is
easier to prevent a horse from running away than it
is to stop him when he is once fairly off.</p>

<p>It would be very difficult to foresee all the possible
defensive actions of the horse and the means
of counteracting them; but, as the rider gains experience,
she will get to recognize these actions from
the outset, and counteract them so naturally that
she will scarcely think about it. To a good rider
there is no such thing as a restive horse. The animal
either knows what to do, or he does not. If he
knows, the rider, by the power of her effects, forces
the horse to obey; if he does not know, the rider
trains him. If a horse resists, there is always a
cause; and that cause should be sought and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>stroyed,
after which the horse will ask no better than
to behave himself.</p>

<p>If a horse fidgets and frets to get back to the
stable (which is a common and annoying trick), he
should be turned round and walked for a moment
or two in an opposite direction, away from home,
and in a fortnight he will have lost the bad habit.</p>

<p>Horses often have a trick of fighting the hand by
running out their heads and trying to pull the reins
through the fingers of their riders. This comes from
stiffness in the hind quarters, and will stop as soon
as the horse has been taught, by progressive flexions,
to keep his hind legs under him.</p>

<p>A timid horse may always be reassured and quieted
by a persevering rider, provided his sight is not bad;
and he should never be punished for shying, as that
comes from fright; he should be allowed time to get
used to the sight or sound of a terrifying object, and,
when he is convinced that it will not hurt him, he
will disregard it in future, as, although timid, he is
not a coward. For instance: if a horse shies at a
gnarled stump in a country lane, his rider should
stop and let him come slowly up to it, which he will
do with every appearance of fear. She should cheer
him with her voice, and caress him with her hand;
and, when once he has come near enough to smell
the dreaded shape, he will give a contemptuous sniff,
and never notice it after.</p>

<p>If a horse should fall with his rider, she should
at once slip her foot out of the stirrup, lift her right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
leg over the pommel, and turn her body quickly to
the left. If the horse falls to the right, she will fall
on him, which will deaden the shock, and, as his legs
will be on the left, she can get away from his feet
easily; if he falls to the left, she must try to let her
head fall to the right, and, if she has time, she will
attempt to fall to the left, on her knees, and must
get away from the horse on her hands and knees
with all speed.</p>

<p>If she should be thrown from her saddle, she
must not stiffen herself, and must keep her head as
high as possible.</p>


<p>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>Before closing this slight treatise, I would most
respectfully say a parting word to the ladies for
whose use I have prepared it.</p>

<p>The principle of the proper control of a horse by
a lady may be thus roughly summed up: Keep him
well under your control, but also keep him going
forward; <i>carry</i> him forward with the pressure of
your left leg and with the whip, which must take
the place of the right leg. Never let a horse take a
step at his own will; and, as soon as he shows the first
sign of resistance, try to counteract it. Great care
and tact must be used to avoid sudden changes of
gait, which irritate a horse by throwing him off his
balance and measure; and he should never be teased
with the whip and spur in order that he may prance
and fidget, for such foolishness on horseback proves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
nothing, and is only fit to amuse ignorant spectators.</p>

<p>Be prudent; accidents always happen too soon.
Be calm, if you wish your horse to be so. Be just,
and he will submit to your will. Remember that, in
riding, the greatest beauty consists in being simple
in your means of control; do not appear to be always
occupied with your horse, for you and he should
seem to have the same will.</p>

<p>Do not read or study one method only; there is
good to be found in all.</p>

<p class="center">By IRENÆUS P. DAVIS, M. D.</p>

<p class="center"><i>18mo. Cloth, $1.25.</i></p>


<p>"Many a woman whose childhood was bright with promise endures
an after-life of misery because, through a false delicacy, she remained
ignorant of her physical nature and requirements, although on all other
subjects she may be well-informed; and so at length she goes to her
grave mourning the hard fate that has made existence a burden, and
perhaps wondering to what end she was born, when a little knowledge
at the proper time would have shown her how to easily avoid those
evils that have made her life a wretched failure."&mdash;<i>From Introduction.</i></p>

<p>"A very useful book for parents who have daughters is 'Hygiene
for Girls,' by Irenæus P. Davis, M. D., published by D. Appleton &amp; Co.
And it is just the book for an intelligent, well-instructed girl to read
with care. It is not a text-book, nor does it bristle with technical
terms. But it tells in simple language just what girls should do and
not to do to preserve the health and strength, to realize the joys, and
prepare for the duties of a woman's lot. It is written with a delicacy,
too, which a mother could hardly surpass in talking with her daughter."&mdash;<i>Christian
at Work.</i></p>

<p>"If the reader is a father, and has a daughter of suitable age, let
him place this volume in her hands with an earnest and affectionate
charge to read it through deliberately, with much thought and self-examination;
if a mother, let her sit down with her daughter and read
together with her these chapters, with such comments and direct
application of its teachings, and such instructions and tender entreaties
coming of personal experience and observation, as are befitting
only the sacred confidences of mother and daughter. It is the most
sensible book on the subject treated we have ever read&mdash;simple and
intelligible, the language always fitting and delicate in treating subjects
requiring judgment and discretion, and pervaded with such a
parental and solicitous kindness that it can not fail to win the attention
and confidence of every young woman."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
